when you switch between work and home.

-- Configure the DI --

Startup.cs -- check your notes.
ConfigureServices: where we inject the classes from the Common project
as Singletons. (Depending on the kind of app you're writing, you
won't always use Singleton; sometimes other things.)

-- Add the ConnectionString --

WAIT. WHY is this not updating on GitHub? Ugh.
